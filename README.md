  ### Scope
  #### <ins> Functional requirements</ins>
       * Performance: the markers on the map should load fast and the user should be able to get the status of every car park in the area at a glance.
       * Mobile responsiveness: Should look clear and easy to read as user might need to decide the next best car park location while in the car (while stopping somewhere)
       * Localization criteria: Only applicable in Singapore as the car park information are taken from the local government API
       * Accessibility criteria: Targer users are fit drivers
       * Not applicable:
                      * Privacy: No user informaiton will be needed
                      * Security: Security is based on the server that provides the API.
